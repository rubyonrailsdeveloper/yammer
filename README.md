The Yammer Ruby Gem
====================
A Ruby wrapper for the Yammer REST APIs

This wrapper is heavily inspired by the [Twitter](https://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter) Ruby Gem (which is AWESOME and you should definitely check)

This gem wouldn't have been possible with the awesomeness of the Twitter Gem and the work **all** their contributors have put into it (and all the other great libraries we depend upon). Please consider [financially supporting the development](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/1193) of the Twitter Ruby Gem.

Installation
------------
    gem install yammer

What's in 0.1.2?
----------------

This release offers some additional API support thanks to [ybenjo](https://github.com/ybenjo), eg suggestions, search and groups.

We still only offer the most basic support for [Yammer's REST API](https://developer.yammer.com/api/).
This gem is **far** from finished or offering complete coverage of all the API methods offered by Yammer. It's our first release covering our basic needs to hook into the messages API.

We are releasing this early version in order to share the path we have taken, offer the community a new Ruby Gem to interact with the Yammer API and build upon it with more support of others that might find it useful.

I am eternally grateful for the work that the team that created the awesome (did I say how awesome that Gem is already? ;) ) [Twitter](https://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter) Ruby Gem put into it and made it open and free. **THANK YOU** :)
